> Example CRUD API using FastAPI

This repository is a result of wading through converting from 
synchronous CRUD operations to asynchronous using the backend 
core from the excellent generator template by Sebastián Ramírez, 
[Full Stack FastAPI and PostgreSQL - Base Project Generator][tiangolo/fullstack].

In reviewing [the FastAPI docs][fastapidocs], the [encode/databases docs][databases-queries]
on queries, and the gitter channels, there seemed to be only the basic 
information on using databases with SQL Alchemy and data table 
definitions that would not work well with Alembic autogenerate - as least in 
my case using the generator template.  This repository is the working result
of my tests and learning to use FastAPU with async, asycnpg, databases, and Alembic 
autogenerated migrations with declarative base model.  Hopefully it will be useful 
to others looking for some examples of using databases, asyncpg and Alembic with FastAPI.


## Details

* **Uses version 0.4.0 of the [Fullstack generator][tiangolo/fullstack-v4]**: 
before current changes in structure of the project were made.
* **[encode/databases][databases-queries]**: To simplify managing connections, pooling, etc.   
* **asyncpg with Posgresql**: Built using a Postgresql 12 database, but can be altered to use SQLite.
* **[Alembic][alembic]**: Using autogenerate to create migrations.  

## To Do
